This is a practice game I developed to learn THREE.JS.
Three.js is a popular JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D graphics in a web browser. It leverages WebGL, which is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.
